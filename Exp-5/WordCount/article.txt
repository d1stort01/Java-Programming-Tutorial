Hello there! I wanted to say hello to everyone reading this article.
Hello, world! It's a beautiful day to say hello.
Some people say "HELLO" loudly, while others whisper "hello".
No matter how you spell it—Hello, HELLO, or hello—the meaning stays the same.
So, hello again, and thank you for reading.
